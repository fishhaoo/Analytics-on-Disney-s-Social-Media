# Analytics-on-Disney-s-Social-Media
## This is an assignment

In this 5-person grouped assignment, we are required to perform analytics on a brand's social media usage. We chose Disney+ because it is interesting to see how they compete against Netflix. The report is lengthy due to assignment requirement, thus if you wanted to look at the important parts, do read into the "discussion" part of each section. I am fully in charged of research topic 1 and my codes are applicable for that only. 

For my research topic, I looked into how Disney+ is performing across 3 social media sites which are Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. I used 3 different py files because the 3 sites involve 3 different tools and techniques in mining the data. The main analytics I am performing is text sentiment analytics where I looked into the sentiment score of the comments and see how the users react with them and compare across different social media platforms. At the same time, statistics score(like, share, comment) counts are also considered to provide better comparison. In the end, a suggestion was provided to conclude the whole report.
